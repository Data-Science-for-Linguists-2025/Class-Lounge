# "Bluesky on Algospeak" by Sara Rosneau
Welcome to my guestbook! Feel free to leave comments on my project.

Comments from Qidu:
- I like that your data sharing plan: the entire dataset, and your rationale for it.
- I like the structure of your notebooks and code.
- You may want to include a table of contents at the beginning of each file 
    This may help readers.
- One thing I learned/may do in the future: use blue sky to gather social media data for my own research. I use 
    stack exchange, which limits my data acquisition to some extent. 

Comments from Lillian:
- I think it's very cool to see this on BlueSky, which has no algorithm as it seems that algo-speak would be used for no reason, but the language persists across social media without care for the actual platform. That being said, I think BlueSky is a great platform for this investigation.
- I think if you are questioning the validity of 'grape' being used because it has a context outside of algo-speak, it is also likely you may want to adress 'watermelon' as well, because I would imagine that would have other meanings besides in reference to Palestine.
- The use of emojis in this is just super fascinating to me and rasies a bunch of questions (mostly ebcause I have never seen emojis in a computing eviornemnt haha).I'm curious if you could incorporate other forms of algo-speak that involve emojis, as I already see there are emojis in your corpora. For example, I see things like 's[egg emoji]s' for an already algo-speak term like 'seggs'. Or just adress the idea of algo-speaking algo-speak (for lack of a better way to describe that- like censoring already cenosred words because those words become too popular)

Comments from Jana:
- I like how you present Algospeak in Aims in your README, it is very clear and a great summary of what you'll be doing in your project. On the same line, I really like how you clearly specify the terms you are working on, as for example in "Getting some actual data." The listed terms next to their equivalents is a very clear way to present your specific targets. 
- I would consider collapsing project_report.md and progress_report.md in a single file and removing the other. Having one report after the other makes the timeline very clear and layout your progress nicely.
- To be fully honest, I had no idea about many of the Algospeak terms you're working with, that was something I learned. Project-related: I hadn't thought about how to work with passwords and avoid privacy issues, on your Getting Bsky Data notebook I learned that a good way to do it is to keep your password in a text file as your "private\pw.txt" and use it from there.

Comments from Claire:
- One thing I like about your project is your use of topic modeling as a means of better understanding your data, as opposed to looking for reliable results. YOu mentioned that you were dealing with a small number of posts, but the topic modeling approach could definitely lead to something big if you decided to expand your dataset!
- One avenue for improvement in your project would be to include a walkthrough of your documents and notebooks in your README file. More info on each element is in the progress report, but it might be helpful for the reader to see them in the README!
- One thing I learned from your project is that BlueSky is not algorithmically driven. I love that!

Comments from Jenna:  
- I like how you show the .csv for the data - it makes it easy for those unfamiliar with bluesky to understand what your project is using as data.
- It's helpful that you put definitions of Algospeak terms such as "watermelon" which I hadn't heard before, BUT I feel like for the more abstract ones the "etymology" of each term should be included.  
- I learned about how to look into APIs like the one from Bsky.

Comments from Ashley:
- I like how well you spelled out the process of how you got your data and broke it down into searching for the kay words you're analyzing. Cool to see blusky has some api availability for this kind of stuff
- I find algo speak so grating personally, I find it interesting how a lof of the data seems split! People saying "unalive" sincerely and others saying it in the context of "i hate this word don't say it here"
- I am on bluesky minimally and I never remember to check it, I'm surprised to learn algospeak is being used there so much when there is no algorithm! 
- I agree with previous comments that a table of contents at the top of the notebook I think could be helpful.
- Super interested to see what you have to report in a couple weeks!
