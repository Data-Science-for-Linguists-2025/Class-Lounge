Comments from Qidu:
- I like that your data sharing plan: the entire dataset, and your rationale for it.
- I like the structure of your notebooks and code.
- You may want to include a table of contents at the beginning of each file 
    This may help readers.
- One thing I learned/may do in the future: use blue sky to gather social media data for my own research. I use 
    stack exchange, which limits my data acquisition to some extent. 

Comments from Lillian:
- I think it's very cool to see this on BlueSky, which has no algorithm as it seems that algo-speak would be used for no reason, but the language persists across social media without care for the actual platform. That being said, I think BlueSky is a great platform for this investigation.
- I think if you are questioning the validity of 'grape' being used because it has a context outside of algo-speak, it is also likely you may want to adress 'watermelon' as well, because I would imagine that would have other meanings besides in reference to Palestine.
- The use of emojis in this is just super fascinating to me and rasies a bunch of questions (mostly ebcause I have never seen emojis in a computing eviornemnt haha).I'm curious if you could incorporate other forms of algo-speak that involve emojis, as I already see there are emojis in your corpora. For example, I see things like 's[egg emoji]s' for an already algo-speak term like 'seggs'. Or just adress the idea of algo-speaking algo-speak (for lack of a better way to describe that- like censoring already cenosred words because those words become too popular)

Comments from Jana:
- I like how you present Algospeak in Aims in your README, it is very clear and a great summary of what you'll be doing in your project. On the same line, I really like how you clearly specify the terms you are working on, as for example in "Getting some actual data." The listed terms next to their equivalents is a very clear way to present your specific targets. 
- I would consider collapsing project_report.md and progress_report.md in a single file and removing the other. Having one report after the other makes the timeline very clear and layout your progress nicely.
- To be fully honest, I had no idea about many of the Algospeak terms you're working with, that was something I learned. Project-related: I hadn't thought about how to work with passwords and avoid privacy issues, on your Getting Bsky Data notebook I learned that a good way to do it is to keep your password in a text file as your "private\pw.txt" and use it from there.
