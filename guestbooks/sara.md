Comments from Qidu:
- I like that your data sharing plan: the entire dataset, and your rationale for it.
- I like the structure of your notebooks and code.
- You may want to include a table of contents at the beginning of each file 
    This may help readers.
- One thing I learned/may do in the future: use blue sky to gather social media data for my own research. I use 
    stack exchange, which limits my data acquisition to some extent.
