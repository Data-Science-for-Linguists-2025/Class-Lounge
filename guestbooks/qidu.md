# [Chinese English Code-Switching Analysis](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2025/Chinese-English-Code-Switching-Analysis)
Qidu Fu's project. 
Feel free to leave any comments. 

comments from jenna:
1. your README.md is so well organized & I like how you describe the objectives  
> your functions are designed in such a legible way (which I feel is usually really difficult even for those who are great at coding, so kudos to you)  
2. you specify that SEAME is the dev dataset, but not what the others are. the absence of a label for the other two datasets feels off-kilter. is 'dev' here not the same as the 'dev' in 'train/test/development'?  
3. unsure if there's anything i've yet learned since this is just data collection

Comments from Lillian:
1. I could also agree that your organization is fantastic and I like how your commit messages are informative and how everything is linked within your progress report. In an attempt to give other feedback however, I like that you kepy your experiments with working with the data in 0_collect_data and how organized your jupyter notebooks are themselves.
2. I'm a little confused on your remove_apostrophe function in [1.2_process_data](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2025/Chinese-English-Code-Switching-Analysis/blob/main/1.2_process_data.ipynb). It looks like it's completely removing some of this and I would imagine this lexical information could be important? 
3. I found your definition of code-switching very informative and your explanation of all the groups who comprise of your data (Bilinguals, Chinese english-learners, non-Chinese Chinese learners) was really interesting. There were some cases of code-switching I hadn't really considered before and it's great that you're explaining who exactly is comprising your data.

Comments from Jana:
1. Your Project plan is really complete. Keywords, importance of study and steps are sections that I think are a great decision and very helpful both probably for you to work from and for viewers as well. 
2. I think you could consider including a little introduction or header for the jupyter notebook 0_collect_data.ipynb, I did not realize you did not use that data until I read the project plan and saw your note about it, but I think you could have a mini introduction markdown cell just before the code for context.
3. Even though this is for the section “something I learned,” I wanted to say your analyze_data jupyter notebook is awesome. It helped me discover many things. First, using WordClouds for cluster visualization is a great idea that I had never thought of. Also, I had never heard of langdetect and detect_langs, and it is an amazing tool I am now thinking about using it to detect Spanish mixed in the Catalan files.

Comments from Claire:
1. One thing I liked about your project was your use of relevant class topics in your notebooks. You seem to have a great command of the clustering moel and it's great that youoprinted the cluster dataframe to show the viewer exactly how the clustering model is working.
2. One avenue for improvement is providing more information on the future implications of your project and why exactly your project is important.
3. One thing I learned is that custom functions can be very helpful in a project like this! I might try to build some custom functions myself.
