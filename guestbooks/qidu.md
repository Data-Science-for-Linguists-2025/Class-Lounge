Qidu Fu's project. 
Feel free to leave any comments. 

comments from jenna:
1. your README.md is so well organized & I like how you describe the objectives  
> your functions are designed in such a legible way (which I feel is usually really difficult even for those who are great at coding, so kudos to you)  
2. you specify that SEAME is the dev dataset, but not what the others are. the absence of a label for the other two datasets feels off-kilter. is 'dev' here not the same as the 'dev' in 'train/test/development'?  
3. unsure if there's anything i've yet learned since this is just data collection
