Ashley - 
This is a very interesting project you're undertaking! I've studied endangered and dying languages before (a bit),
but it's a very interesting approach to almost quantify a language's endangerment in this way. I think it's a very useful
study, though, toward the work of assessing language preservation efforts that could be used for Catalan.

Your data procsesing notebooks are extremely well organized and fascinating. The face you found corpora spanning all the years
you have is very cool. I can't want to see what you find over time.

Your data samples are a bit challenging for me to parse (obviously, as someone who doesn't speak Catalan) but they seem to 
contain a lot of information.

I'd never thought of language endangerment as being the sort of inch-by-inch process mentioned or alluded to at least in your
early work... with Spanish squeezing out Catalan little by little over time. Can't wait to see where this project goes!

Claire:

One aspect of your project that I thought you had a very good grasp of was the data sharing portion. You clearly did your research on the different licenses and selected the ones that fit your goals (and the licenses of the data) best. I think it was a great idea to follow the license of the most restrictive portion of your project, which from what I can see from your repo, is the Parlament Parla and ParlaMint corpora, which both require credit of the origial author. Well done!

One suggestion I have is to provide some background on the history of Catalan and its endangerment. I think this would be extremely helpful to visitors of your repo with no prior knowledge or background of Catalan. This would also serve to make the future implications of your project clear!!

One thing I learned from your project is the following quote that you included: â€œwritten language always represents a later stage than the actual appearance of any linguistic phenomenon...". Even as a linguistics student, I never really thought about this and always viewed written language as non-linguistic in nature. Love it!

Qidu's comments:
- I like how logical your progress-report is. You talked about the problems/issues you encoutered
when dealing with the data and provided your methods tackling them
- I also like the visuals you made in the ipynb files. They were interesting and published-research like. I think they will be great for presentation. Good job. 
- You may want to move the contents at the beginning of the ipyn file instead of putting it at 2nd section, which will help readability.
- One thing I learned was to document the issues that I encoutered and methods in solving them in the my next progress_report.
