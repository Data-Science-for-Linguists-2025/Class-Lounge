Ashley - 
This is a very interesting project you're undertaking! I've studied endangered and dying languages before (a bit),
but it's a very interesting approach to almost quantify a language's endangerment in this way. I think it's a very useful
study, though, toward the work of assessing language preservation efforts that could be used for Catalan.

Your data procsesing notebooks are extremely well organized and fascinating. The face you found corpora spanning all the years
you have is very cool. I can't want to see what you find over time.

Your data samples are a bit challenging for me to parse (obviously, as someone who doesn't speak Catalan) but they seem to 
contain a lot of information.

I'd never thought of language endangerment as being the sort of inch-by-inch process mentioned or alluded to at least in your
early work... with Spanish squeezing out Catalan little by little over time. Can't wait to see where this project goes!
