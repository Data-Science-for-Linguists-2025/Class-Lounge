# Ashley's DND Project!

Take a look at my project [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2025/Critical-Role-Analysis)

Please let me know if there is anything you see in my progress reports (or anywhere) I could make more clear :)

Comments from Qidu:
- I like your idea. It is very interesting and I think it is fun project. 
- Your documentation of the your project progress is very detailed and easy to follow.
- I think it may help to reorganize the ipynb files out of the data_samples?. It
    may help readers to understand your data acquisition from the data itself as well.
- It may also help readability when sections/headers/contents are added to ipynb files.
- One thing I learned/will do is the inclusion of time range of my progress in the 
    future as you did in the progress report. It is easy to document the progress with time range. 
	
Response: Thank you for taking a look! It has been a really fun study. 
Thanks for the insights about the notebooks too! I went through and added more commentary and captions that I think made the steps taken more clear :)

Comments from Sara:
- Your data cleaning was very impressive, especially since there is just so much data! You really are a master of regex now :) I also agree with Qidu that your notebooks are easy to follow.
- I'm not exactly sure what you did with overlap, but one way to deal with multiple speakers is to almost vectorize the speaker columns so you can represent different people speaking at once, but I'm not sure how feasible that is really. 
- I wonder if you might want to add a column to represent the DM vs a Player, since a DM is obviously going to speak a lot more often than a player.
- One thing I've learned: I haven't actually tried to do computational discourse analysis yet, but your strategy of separating out non-speech is one I might have to adapt!

Response: Thank you, too! I had that thought too, with a gender column. Na-Rae discouraged it though and encouraged slicing instead (for your own future works I'm sharing)
I'm so glad now to be done with all my Regex!

Comments from Lillian:
- Generally, the readability of your code is great (although I see that's something you've been praised for before)! The analysis of your readability scores are interesting, thorough and well explained/backed! I can't wait to see what other kinds of tests you may employ to analyze your data!
- It looks like your looking at enable as your dictionary to cross-compare when looking for dnd jargon- I know enable does have some funky words, so maybe try to see what funky words could be in it. Perhaps words like 'fae' or 'proficiency' may be in it, but you may still want to consider those words 'dnd jargon'. In that vein, it may be good to try and define what exactly 'dnd jargon' is, just to readers have a clearer idea of what you're looking for as some words could be considered both 'dnd jargon' and standard words.
- I had never heard of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level test, and other readability tests and they're another really interesting test to understand the contexts of your texts!

Comments from Claire:
- One thing I like about your data analysis is your usage of the Norvig Google data set! It's great to see that you're implementing class materials and using them to your advantage in this project! I am considering using the Norvig Google data in my own project. Also, I like your approach of returning tokens that are not in the Norvig data to reveal what is truly jargon.
- One path for improvement would be to 'prettify' your Episode2BearingtheScars.json file so that it is readable on Github! Right now it is a long list that the reader has to scroll through, so I think it would be clearer if it was in the 'vertical' format.
- One thing I learned from your project is that the SMOG Readability Test exists! It is so cool!!

Comments from Jenna:
- I really like the frequency of your md cells describing/explaining what's happening/its importance  
- For your CSV data, what is the column before index?  
- I learned about the NEW CONTINUING method for Jupyter notebooks.

Comments from Jana:
- I really like your “thoughts” sections in your notebooks, they are very helpful and make understanding what you are working with, thinking and planning very easy to follow.
- I think you could update your project plan goals, as your project seems to be much more developed and has gone further than what you have on your project plan. 
- Even though I'm just seeing that Lillian also learned this from your project, I had never heard of the Flesch–Kincaid readability test either! It is so fascinating! The explanation you provide and the graph help a lot as someone who had never heard of it
