# Ashley's DND Project!

Take a look at my project [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2025/Critical-Role-Analysis)

Please let me know if there is anything you see in my progress reports (or anywhere) I could make more clear :)

Comments from Qidu:
- I like your idea. It is very interesting and I think it is fun project. 
- Your documentation of the your project progress is very detailed and easy to follow.
- I think it may help to reorganize the ipynb files out of the data_samples?. It
    may help readers to understand your data acquisition from the data itself as well.
- It may also help readability when sections/headers/contents are added to ipynb files.
- One thing I learned/will do is the inclusion of time range of my progress in the 
    future as you did in the progress report. It is easy to document the progress with time range.
