# Ashley's DND Project!

Take a look at my project [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2025/Critical-Role-Analysis)

Please let me know if there is anything you see in my progress reports (or anywhere) I could make more clear :)

Comments from Qidu:
- I like your idea. It is very interesting and I think it is fun project. 
- Your documentation of the your project progress is very detailed and easy to follow.
- I think it may help to reorganize the ipynb files out of the data_samples?. It
    may help readers to understand your data acquisition from the data itself as well.
- It may also help readability when sections/headers/contents are added to ipynb files.
- One thing I learned/will do is the inclusion of time range of my progress in the 
    future as you did in the progress report. It is easy to document the progress with time range. 

Comments from Sara:
- Your data cleaning was very impressive, especially since there is just so much data! You really are a master of regex now :) I also agree with Qidu that your notebooks are easy to follow.
- I'm not exactly sure what you did with overlap, but one way to deal with multiple speakers is to almost vectorize the speaker columns so you can represent different people speaking at once, but I'm not sure how feasible that is really. 
- I wonder if you might want to add a column to represent the DM vs a Player, since a DM is obviously going to speak a lot more often than a player.
- One thing I've learned: I haven't actually tried to do computational discourse analysis yet, but your strategy of separating out non-speech is one I might have to adapt!
