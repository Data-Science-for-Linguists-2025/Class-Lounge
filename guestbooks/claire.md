Sara's comments:
- Your progress report and notebook are both pretty clear, and this is a really interesting and necessary project!
- AllSides seems to be an interesting website! That being said, putting AP in the same category as Democracy Now seems a bit ridiculous to me, so definitely be a little skeptical of your sources.
- Unfortunately there's no samples of the data, but I would love to see some!
- One thing I've learned: The work on intensifiers seems really cool. It also seems similar to some of the stance work going on in sociolinguistics!
