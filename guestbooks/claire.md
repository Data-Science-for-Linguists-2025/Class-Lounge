Ashley -
I think this is a very cool project idea! Your plan is very thorough so far which is nice, I feel like I have a really good
grasp of what to expect from your project already. 

Have you considered including the use of passive voice in headlines or articles? I feel like I've seen
examples before of the same news story from two different sites with two different framings by active vs passive voice.
(Might not be suited for this iteration of the project, but something that came to my mind)

I appreciate that you spell out the exact sourcing of your data pretty thoroughly. It seems like you put in the work to find
biased news sources while avoiding being biased in your sourcing yourself. Good to see!

Your progree report is nicely organized. I'm taking notes to make my own look just a little bit nicer too :)
