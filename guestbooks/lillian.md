Welcome to my analysis of mono- and bilingual speakers of German and English!! Stay a while and leave a note :)

>> comments from jenna :o (lillian!! I beat you here!! smh)
1. you found a great variety of data 
2. explain what you mean by 'formality' (as far as I know, German doesn't have a "formal" speech like japanese's honorific speech or french's tu/vous distinction with 2PL)
3. idk if there's anything in particular that I've learned yet since this is just data colection
other comments:
- how do you plan on doing the ML with audio data? (jbc we haven't gone over how to use audio data in class)
- btw there's a typo in [LoadingREUGData.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2025/DEU-ENG-Mono-and-Billingual-Speakers/blob/main/LoadingRUEGData.ipynb) where it says 'langauge'
- if you have the speaker ID, could you calculate the true number of mono/bilingual speakers present in the data?
