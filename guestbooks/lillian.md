- how do you plan on doing the ML with audio data? (jbc we haven't gone over how to use audio data in class)
- btw there's a typo in [LoadingREUGData.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2025/DEU-ENG-Mono-and-Billingual-Speakers/blob/main/LoadingRUEGData.ipynb) where it says 'langauge'
- wdym by formality? jbc as far as ik German doesn't have a "formal" way of speaking (like romance languages do with their t/v distinction between you(SG) and you(PL/SG formal) or like japanese with different vocabulary and grammatical rules)
- if you have the speaker ID, could you calculate the true number of mono/bilingual speakers present in the data?
