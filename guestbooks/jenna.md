1. I like the idea of discussing the data’s pros and cons. I feel like it’s a great way to lay out some of the issues it might pose and weigh them against its strengths. I think it’s a quick but effective way to consider what data you are working with. Also, your hypothesis is clearly stated in your project plan, which makes the project goal clear and inviting/engaging. I'm looking forward to seeing if your hypothesis is actually correct. 
2. Although I think it’s great how you link and mention all the resources you used very clearly in your progress report, I think putting all these resources in one section would be a good idea. (I’m referring to tools such as the regex cheatsheet or the Scrapy tutorial). Maybe you could have like a little section under each of the report entries saying something like:\
**Resources used:**\
Regex cheatsheet used for XYZ\
Scrappy’s tutorial(link) used to XYZ\
(etc.)
3. I learned that there’s Scarpy code that doesn’t work without being in an active Scrapy project directory or when using VS code. Also, I had never heard of Archive of Our Own (AO3), and it seems like a fantastic resource, even though it doesn’t allow sharing the data.

I see that your project is very heavy on the web scraping! Mine is too!! I really like that you took the time to do some tutorials on webscraping. This will definitely help you not only on this project, but in the long run too if you decide to ever use webscraping again in your academic or professional career! It looks like you also took a look at another students project to see how they navigated AO3 pages. This is a great approach! No need to reinvent the wheel.

One suggestion I have is actually a super fun website that I have been using for fun and to improve my regex skills! I even showed it to my sister and she loved it! It is a regex crossword puzzle website that is SUPER helpful! Here is a link! [Regex-Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com). I am also using a lot of regex in my project and this website/game has made my project SO much more approachable.

One thing I learned from your project is that AO3 is very universal! Admittedly I didn't know much about the website before, so it is very cool to know that it features authors from all around the world.
