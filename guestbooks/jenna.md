1. I like the idea of discussing the data’s pros and cons. I feel like it’s a great way to lay out some of the issues it might pose and weigh them against its strengths. I think it’s a quick but effective way to consider what data you are working with. Also, your hypothesis is clearly stated in your project plan, which makes the project goal clear and inviting/engaging. I'm looking forward to seeing if your hypothesis is actually correct. 
2. Although I think it’s great how you link and mention all the resources you used very clearly in your progress report, I think putting all these resources in one section would be a good idea. (I’m referring to tools such as the regex cheatsheet or the Scrapy tutorial). Maybe you could have like a little section under each of the report entries saying something like:\
**Resources used:**\
Regex cheatsheet used for XYZ\
Scrappy’s tutorial(link) used to XYZ\
(etc.)
3. I learned that there’s Scarpy code that doesn’t work without being in an active Scrapy project directory or when using VS code. Also, I had never heard of Archive of Our Own (AO3), and it seems like a fantastic resource, even though it doesn’t allow sharing the data.
